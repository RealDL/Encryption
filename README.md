# Encryption
A simple asymmetric encryption program.

# Pre-set up:
1. Install python IDLE [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
2. Make sure you install it **with** path as it makes installing external libraries really easy.
3. Don't worry about external libraries as there are none.

# Set up:
1. Download this repository.
2. Extract it all.

# How to run:
1. Run it with Python IDLE or CMD or Powershell it doesn't really matter.

# Notes
1. The code has been designed to be a bullet proof encryption method.
2. The encryption does work but it can break so be careful what you want encrypting.
3. Finally, if you need any help feel free to message me if you find any errors or you are struggling to set this up. My Discord is @realdl
